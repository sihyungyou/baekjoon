Hooray! Polycarp turned 𝑛 years old! The Technocup Team sincerely congratulates Polycarp!

Polycarp celebrated all of his 𝑛 birthdays: from the 1-th to the 𝑛-th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many times he turned beautiful number of years?

According to Polycarp, a positive integer is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times. For example, the following numbers are beautiful: 1, 77, 777, 44 and 999999. The following numbers are not beautiful: 12, 11110, 6969 and 987654321.

Of course, Polycarpus uses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10).

Help Polycarpus to find the number of numbers from 1 to 𝑛 (inclusive) that are beautiful.

Input
The first line contains an integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤104) — the number of test cases in the input. Then 𝑡 test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line, which contains a positive integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤109) — how many years Polycarp has turned.

Output
Print 𝑡 integers — the answers to the given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer: the number of beautiful years between 1 and 𝑛, inclusive.
